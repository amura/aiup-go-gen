However, the inherent exchange\nof information between agents and their interaction with external environments,\nsuch as LLM, tools, and users, inevitably introduces significant risks of\nsensitive data leakage, including vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt\ninjection and reconnaissance. Existing MACS fail to enable privacy controls,\nmaking it challenging to manage sensitive information securely. In this paper,\nwe take the first step to address the MACS's data leakage threat at the system\ndevelopment level through a privacy-enhanced development paradigm, Maris. Maris\nenables rigorous message flow control within MACS by embedding reference\nmonitors into key multi-agent conversation components. We implemented Maris as\nan integral part of AutoGen, a widely adopted open-source multi-agent\ndevelopment framework. Then, we evaluate Maris for its effectiveness and\nperformance overhead on privacy-critical MACS use cases, including healthcare,\nsupply chain optimization, and personalized recommendation system. The result\nshows that Maris achieves satisfactory effectiveness, performance overhead and\npracticability for adoption.

Our approach features\nautonomous and iterative processes covering the entire research lifecycle--from\nideation and literature review to economic modeling and data processing,\nempirical analysis and result interpretation--with strategic human oversight.\nThe workflow architecture comprises specialized agents with clearly defined\nroles, structured inter-agent communication protocols, systematic error\nescalation pathways, and adaptive mechanisms that respond to changing research\ndemand. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints are strategically integrated to\nensure methodological validity and ethical compliance. We demonstrate the\npractical implementation of our framework using Microsoft's open-source\nplatform, AutoGen, presenting experimental examples that highlight both the\ncurrent capabilities and future potential of agentic workflows in improving\neconomic research.

The digital\ntwin integrates three key components of the closed-loop operation: (1) fuzzy\nlogic for expert control, (2) a state-space model for regulatory control, and\n(3) a recurrent neural network to simulate the SAG mill process. The digital\ntwin is combined with a statistical framework for automatically detecting\nprocess disturbances (or critical operations), which triggers model retraining\nonly when deviations from expected behaviour are identified, ensuring\ncontinuous updates with new data to enhance the SAG supervision. The model was\ntrained with 68 hours of operational industrial data and validated with an\nadditional 8 hours, allowing it to predict mill behaviour within a 2.5-minute\nhorizon at 30-second intervals with errors smaller than 5%.

Current assessments of autonomy often focus on\nspecific risks and rely on run-time evaluations -- observations of agent\nactions during operation. We introduce a code-based assessment of autonomy that\neliminates the need to run an AI agent to perform specific tasks, thereby\nreducing the costs and risks associated with run-time evaluations. Using this\ncode-based framework, the orchestration code used to run an AI agent can be\nscored according to a taxonomy that assesses attributes of autonomy: impact and\noversight. We demonstrate this approach with the AutoGen framework and select\napplications. Title:Measuring AI agent autonomy: Towards a scalable approach with code\n  inspection URL:http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15212v1] map[Authors:Zhenhong Zhou, Zherui Li, Jie Zhang, Yuanhe Zhang, Kun Wang, Yang Liu, Qing Guo Summary:Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MASs) have demonstrated\nremarkable real-world capabilities, effectively collaborating to complete\ncomplex tasks. While these systems are designed with safety mechanisms, such as\nrejecting harmful instructions through alignment, their security remains\nlargely unexplored. This gap leaves LLM-MASs vulnerable to targeted\ndisruptions. In this paper, we introduce Contagious Recursive Blocking Attacks\n(Corba), a novel and simple yet highly effective attack that disrupts\ninteractions between agents within an LLM-MAS. Corba leverages two key\nproperties: its contagious nature allows it to propagate across arbitrary\nnetwork topologies, while its recursive property enables sustained depletion of\ncomputational resources. Notably, these blocking attacks often involve\nseemingly benign instructions, making them particularly challenging to mitigate\nusing conventional alignment methods. We evaluate Corba on two widely-used\nLLM-MASs, namely, AutoGen and Camel across various topologies and commercial\nmodels. Additionally, we conduct more extensive experiments in open-ended\ninteractive LLM-MASs, demonstrating the effectiveness of Corba in complex\ntopology structures and open-source models. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/zhrli324/Corba.

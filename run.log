However, the inherent exchange\nof information between agents and their interaction with external environments,\nsuch as LLM, tools, and users, inevitably introduces significant risks of\nsensitive data leakage, including vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt\ninjection and reconnaissance. Existing MACS fail to enable privacy controls,\nmaking it challenging to manage sensitive information securely. In this paper,\nwe take the first step to address the MACS's data leakage threat at the system\ndevelopment level through a privacy-enhanced development paradigm, Maris. Maris\nenables rigorous message flow control within MACS by embedding reference\nmonitors into key multi-agent conversation components. We implemented Maris as\nan integral part of AutoGen, a widely adopted open-source multi-agent\ndevelopment framework. Then, we evaluate Maris for its effectiveness and\nperformance overhead on privacy-critical MACS use cases, including healthcare,\nsupply chain optimization, and personalized recommendation system. The result\nshows that Maris achieves satisfactory effectiveness, performance overhead and\npracticability for adoption.

Our approach features\nautonomous and iterative processes covering the entire research lifecycle--from\nideation and literature review to economic modeling and data processing,\nempirical analysis and result interpretation--with strategic human oversight.\nThe workflow architecture comprises specialized agents with clearly defined\nroles, structured inter-agent communication protocols, systematic error\nescalation pathways, and adaptive mechanisms that respond to changing research\ndemand. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints are strategically integrated to\nensure methodological validity and ethical compliance. We demonstrate the\npractical implementation of our framework using Microsoft's open-source\nplatform, AutoGen, presenting experimental examples that highlight both the\ncurrent capabilities and future potential of agentic workflows in improving\neconomic research.

The digital\ntwin integrates three key components of the closed-loop operation: (1) fuzzy\nlogic for expert control, (2) a state-space model for regulatory control, and\n(3) a recurrent neural network to simulate the SAG mill process. The digital\ntwin is combined with a statistical framework for automatically detecting\nprocess disturbances (or critical operations), which triggers model retraining\nonly when deviations from expected behaviour are identified, ensuring\ncontinuous updates with new data to enhance the SAG supervision. The model was\ntrained with 68 hours of operational industrial data and validated with an\nadditional 8 hours, allowing it to predict mill behaviour within a 2.5-minute\nhorizon at 30-second intervals with errors smaller than 5%.

Current assessments of autonomy often focus on\nspecific risks and rely on run-time evaluations -- observations of agent\nactions during operation. We introduce a code-based assessment of autonomy that\neliminates the need to run an AI agent to perform specific tasks, thereby\nreducing the costs and risks associated with run-time evaluations. Using this\ncode-based framework, the orchestration code used to run an AI agent can be\nscored according to a taxonomy that assesses attributes of autonomy: impact and\noversight. We demonstrate this approach with the AutoGen framework and select\napplications.

While these systems are designed with safety mechanisms, such as\nrejecting harmful instructions through alignment, their security remains\nlargely unexplored. This gap leaves LLM-MASs vulnerable to targeted\ndisruptions. In this paper, we introduce Contagious Recursive Blocking Attacks\n(Corba), a novel and simple yet highly effective attack that disrupts\ninteractions between agents within an LLM-MAS. Corba leverages two key\nproperties: its contagious nature allows it to propagate across arbitrary\nnetwork topologies, while its recursive property enables sustained depletion of\ncomputational resources. Notably, these blocking attacks often involve\nseemingly benign instructions, making them particularly challenging to mitigate\nusing conventional alignment methods. We evaluate Corba on two widely-used\nLLM-MASs, namely, AutoGen and Camel across various topologies and commercial\nmodels. Additionally, we conduct more extensive experiments in open-ended\ninteractive LLM-MASs, demonstrating the effectiveness of Corba in complex\ntopology structures and open-source models.

Here's a general outline of what you should do:\n\n1. **Install Node.js and Angular CLI:** \n   First, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node package manager) installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Then, install Angular CLI globally using npm:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g @angular/cli\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a New Angular App:** \n   Use Angular CLI to generate a new Angular app. You can name it `user-login-app` or anything you prefer:\n\n   ```bash\n   ng new user-login-app\n   ```\n\n   This command will prompt you to choose additional settings like routing and styles. Customize these based on your preferences.\n\n3. **Navigate into Your New App Directory:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cd user-login-app\n   ```\n\n4. **Generate Login Component:**\n   Use the Angular CLI to generate a new component for your login functionality:\n\n   ```bash\n   ng generate component login\n   ```\n\n5. **Add Login Logic and Template:**\n   Populate your `login.component.ts` and `login.component.html` with the code necessary to build your login form.\n\n   Here’s a simple example of a login form:\n\n   **login.component.html**\n   ```html\n   <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #loginForm=\"ngForm\">\n     <div>\n       <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n       <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" required [(ngModel)]=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n     </div>\n     <div>\n       <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n       <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" required [(ngModel)]=\"password\" name=\"password\">\n     </div>\n     <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n   **login.component.ts**\n   ```typescript\n   import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n   @Component({\n     selector: 'app-login',\n     templateUrl: './login.component.html',\n     styleUrls: ['./login.component.css']\n   })\n   export class LoginComponent {\n\n     email: string;\n     password: string;\n\n     constructor() {}\n\n     onSubmit() {\n       // Implement your login logic here.\n       console.log('Email:', this.email);\n       console.log('Password:', this.password);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Add Routing (Optional):**\n   If you opted for routing during the setup, ensure that the login component is part of your application’s routes.\n\n   In `app-routing.module.ts`, add a route for your login component:\n\n   ```typescript\n   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n   import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n   import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component';\n\n   const routes: Routes = [\n     { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent },\n     // other routes...\n   ];\n\n   @NgModule({\n     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\n     exports: [RouterModule]\n   })\n   export class AppRoutingModule { }\n   ```\n\n7. **Run Your Application:**\n   Finally, start the Angular development server:\n\n   ```bash\n   ng serve\n   ```\n\n   Once it’s running, you can access your app at `http://localhost:4200`. Go to `http://localhost:4200/login` to see your login component in action.\n\nThis sets up a basic framework for a user login Angular app. You might want to expand this with additional functionalities such as form validation, authentication services, or connection to a backend for verifying login credentials.","time":1748591200543,"caller":"/Users/amakura/source/repos/aiup-go-gen/internal/agent/assistant.go:64","message":"LLM response received"}

Customize these based on your preferences.\n\n3. **Navigate into Your New App Directory:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cd user-login-app\n   ```\n\n4. **Generate Login Component:**\n   Use the Angular CLI to generate a new component for your login functionality:\n\n   ```bash\n   ng generate component login\n   ```\n\n5. **Add Login Logic and Template:**\n   Populate your `login.component.ts` and `login.component.html` with the code necessary to build your login form.\n\n   Here’s a simple example of a login form:\n\n   **login.component.html**\n   ```html\n   <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #loginForm=\"ngForm\">\n     <div>\n       <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n       <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" required [(ngModel)]=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n     </div>\n     <div>\n       <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n       <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" required [(ngModel)]=\"password\" name=\"password\">\n     </div>\n     <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n   **login.component.ts**\n   ```typescript\n   import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n   @Component({\n     selector: 'app-login',\n     templateUrl: './login.component.html',\n     styleUrls: ['./login.component.css']\n   })\n   export class LoginComponent {\n\n     email: string;\n     password: string;\n\n     constructor() {}\n\n     onSubmit() {\n       // Implement your login logic here.\n       console.log('Email:', this.email);\n       console.log('Password:', this.password);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Add Routing (Optional):**\n   If you opted for routing during the setup, ensure that the login component is part of your application’s routes.\n\n   In `app-routing.module.ts`, add a route for your login component:\n\n   ```typescript\n   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n   import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n   import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component';\n\n   const routes: Routes = [\n     { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent },\n     // other routes...\n   ];\n\n   @NgModule({\n     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\n     exports: [RouterModule]\n   })\n   export class AppRoutingModule { }\n   ```\n\n7. **Run Your Application:**\n   Finally, start the Angular development server:\n\n   ```bash\n   ng serve\n   ```\n\n   Once it’s running, you can access your app at `http://localhost:4200`. Go to `http://localhost:4200/login` to see your login component in action.\n\nThis sets up a basic framework for a user login Angular app. You might want to expand this with additional functionalities such as form validation, authentication services, or connection to a backend for verifying login credentials.","time":1748591200545,"caller":"/Users/amakura/source/repos/aiup-go-gen/internal/agent/assistant.go:70","message":"About to parse response and check for tool calling"}

Provide some basic HTML template and TypeScript code for the login component.\n\nLet's get started by setting up the Angular project and creating the login component.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool\": \"docker_exec\",\n  \"args\": {\n    \"language\": \"angular-cli\",\n    \"code\": [\n      \"ng new user-login-app --defaults --skip-git\",\n      \"cd user-login-app\",\n      \"ng generate component login\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```","time":1748651131934,"caller":"/Users/amakura/source/repos/aiup-go-gen/internal/agent/assistant.go:93","message":"About to parse response and check for tool calling"}

You can answer coding questions, help with Python and Go code, or use special tools for advanced tasks.\n\n\t\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\nAvailable tools:\ngithub_mcp: Use this tool to interact with the GitHub MCP API (repository, issue, user management, etc.).\n\nfetch_arxiv: Fetch recent arXiv papers on a given topic.\ndocker_exec: Execute code/scripts in a Docker container. Supports python, bash, sh, dotnet, angular cli, npm.\nstripe_mcp: Use this tool to interact with the Stripe MCP API (customer, charge, payment intent, etc.).\n\n\nWhen requested to generate some code, you must execute, test, or verify code, and always use the docker_exec tool. This tool allows you to run Python, Bash, Node.js, dotnet, or Angular CLI code inside a secure Docker container.\nYou must not ask the user to run code on their machine or provide instructions for running code. Instead, you should always use the docker_exec tool to execute code in a controlled environment.\nIf you need to execute code, output a JSON object that specifies the tool to call and the arguments required for execution.\n\nWhen you need to use a function/tool, reply ONLY with a JSON code block (no narrative), using the JSON format:\n{\n  \"tool\": \"docker_exec\",\n  \"args\": {\n    \"language\": \"<language name, e.g. python, bash, node, dotnet, angular-cli>\",\n    \"code\": \"<code to execute as a string>\",\n    \"requirements\": \"<optional: dependencies or package list>\",\n    \"env\": { \"<ENV_VAR>\": \"value\" },\n    \"init\": \"<optional: The name of the initialization script or commands to run before executing code, such as npm i, pip install dotnet packages, etc.>\",\n    \"launch\": \"<optional: path to a shell script to execute when launching the main code, e.g. 'start.sh'>\"\n  }\n}\n\nExample:\n{\n  \"tool\": \"docker_exec\",\n  \"args\": {\n    \"language\": \"python\",\n    \"code\": \"print('Hello world!')\"  // or multiple code blocks ring fenced with triple backticks,\n    \"init\": \"pip install requests\",\n    \"launch\": \"start.sh\",\n  }\n}\n\nNever output code for execution/testing directly—**always** use the docker_exec tool and follow the output json above.\n\nOtherwise, answer directly.\n\nUser request: [Orchestrator LLM ERROR]: OpenAI API error: error, status code: 400, status: 400 Bad Request, message: Invalid 'tools[0].function.name': string does not match pattern.
